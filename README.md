# statistics-liferay-6-1
-
It was a project shared by Google Code Hosting Projects.
-

In this plugin I used the Google Charts API Tools with statistics to show graphically the portal in which it is used. 

The statitishce are divided into two main categories: 
1) portal 
2) user logged in 

Then later you can choose the type of chart (bar, line, pie, etc.) and what to see or to compare.
